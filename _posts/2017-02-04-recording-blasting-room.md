We're extremely excited to announce that we're recording at the legendary [The Blasting Room](http://www.blastingroomstudios.com/)! We'll be heading up to Fort Collins, CO, the first week in April to begin tracking our next record "Don't Try So Hard". [Stephen Egerton](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.egerton) will once again be mixing. STOKED.

Needless to say we've got zero shows between now and then so we'll see you guys in April!
